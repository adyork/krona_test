# krona_test

This is a test site, not meant to be a long term reference.
FullTaxa.krona.html was written by Alexander Bochdansky.

You can download a krona plot html file in this repository to open and view on your own computer.  

This repository is configured to provide view of the plot using GitHub Pages at
https://adyork.github.io/krona_test/FullTaxa.krona.html

Setup for Github pages with Krona can be done many ways, these are the exact steps for this simple setup to make the Github Pages work (github.io):
1. Create new repository
2. Upload your krona .HTML (you can do this with the Add File button on your main repo code page.)
2. Go to Settings->Pages
3. Change "Deploy from a Branch" to "GitHub Actions"
4. Click "Configure" button in "Static HTML" box.
5. Press Commit.  
6. Wait.  It takes about a minute or so for the github environment to get setup.  If you go to your main repo page you will see a new section show up on the right side panel called "Github environments" and an option to open the main page of your github.io.  But in any case you need to construct the fill link. For example:
https://adyork.github.io/krona_test/FullTaxa.krona.html


https://<yourUsername>.github.io/<your Repo name>/<your krona plot name>.html
